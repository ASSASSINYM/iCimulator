        AVCaptureStillImageOutput can only satisfy a limited number of image requests in a single bracket without exhausting system resources. The maximum number of still images that may be taken in a single bracket depends on the size of the images being captured, and consequently may vary with AVCaptureSession -sessionPreset and AVCaptureDevice -activeFormat. Some formats do not support bracketed capture and return a maxBracketedCaptureStillImageCount of 0. This read-only property is key-value observable. If you exceed -maxBracketedCaptureStillImageCount, then -captureStillImageBracketAsynchronouslyFromConnection:withSettingsArray:completionHandler: fails and the completionHandler is called [settings count] times with a NULL sample buffer and AVErrorMaximumStillImageCaptureRequestsExceeded.

     @discussion
        On a receiver where -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported returns YES, lens stabilization may be applied to the bracket to reduce blur commonly found in low light photos. When lens stabilization is enabled, bracketed still image captures incur additional latency. Lens stabilization is more effective with longer-exposure captures, and offers limited or no benefit for exposure durations shorter than 1/30 of a second. It is possible that during the bracket, the lens stabilization module may run out of correction range and therefore will not be active for every frame in the bracket. Each emitted CMSampleBuffer from the bracket will have an attachment of kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_StillImageLensStabilizationInfo indicating additional information about stabilization was applied to the buffer, if any. The default value of -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureEnabled is NO. This value will be set to NO when -isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported changes to NO.
